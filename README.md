# Vegetable Image-Classification

<!-- abstract summarizing the project -->
## Abstract
This project develops a deep learning framework to classify images of vegetables. It compares various convolutional neural network models and transfer learning models using a dataset of vegetable images. The project also includes an end-to-end application for real-time classification.

<!-- Introduction to the project -->
## Introduction
The project addresses the need for automating vegetable classification processes. It takes inspiration from Amazon's smart grocery store and aims to remove manual efforts in selecting, sorting, and labeling vegetables. By utilizing computer vision algorithms and deep learning techniques, the project presents a preliminary step towards achieving automated vegetable classification.
